# Security posture (v1 tracer)

Honest, per-surface security notes for the v1 tracer bullet. Sections are added
by the ticket that lands the surface they describe. Everything here is the
public-demo profile; the demo data is synthetic and labelled synthetic.

## Registry (API Center) access

The API Center data-plane MCP registry endpoint is **Entra-protected by
default**: unauthenticated requests are rejected (401). Read access is not
configurable through the `Microsoft.ApiCenter` ARM/azapi surface in any
published API version as of 2026-07-12, so this posture is platform-determined,
not something the module sets. (Microsoft Learn documents Entra ID as the
recommended access method and anonymous access as an explicit opt-in; the exact
unauthenticated-response code is confirmed at the live gate, not asserted from a
doc page.)

Every consumer inside the Entra trust boundary reads the registry
**authenticated**:

- **Test harness (this tracer).** Ticket 5's bounded poll authenticates with an
  OIDC principal that holds the **Azure API Center Data Reader** role on the
  instance, granted by the `api-center-registry` module via
  `data_reader_principal_ids`.
- **Foundry tool-catalog integration.** A tool-catalog integration with API
  Center exists; its exact registry auth mechanics are to be verified at that
  phase, not assumed here.
- **Custom agents.** Read via their own managed identity holding Data Reader on
  the instance.

**Anonymous access is a portal-only opt-in this deployment does not use.** It is
toggled in the Azure portal (Consumption > Portal settings > Access tab); there
is no IaC surface for it. Its known consumer is **GitHub Copilot's registry
integration**, which reads the registry without an Entra token. The cost of
enabling it is **public enumerability of registered server and tool metadata**
(server names, endpoint URLs, transport types, tool descriptions). This
deployment keeps the authenticated default; the optional, Copilot-only
enablement steps are in `docs/runbooks/registry-anonymous-access.md`.

Regardless of read mode, **nothing sensitive is placed in registered metadata**:
the inventory carries service/tool descriptions and endpoint URLs for the
synthetic demo server only, no secrets, tokens, or tenant/subscription
identifiers.
